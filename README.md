# Motorcycle Racing Game

This is a simple 3D motorcycle racing prototype that runs in the browser. It uses [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for rendering. Arrow keys are used to control the bike.

## Running locally

1. Install Node.js (version 14 or newer).
2. In the project directory run:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play.

The server is a minimal HTTP server implemented in `server.js`. Online multiplayer functionality can be added later on top of this server.
