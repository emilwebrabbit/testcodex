# 2D Racing Game

This repository now contains a small 2D racing demo that runs directly in the browser using the `<canvas>` element. Arrow keys are used to control the vehicle.

## Running locally

1. Install Node.js (version 14 or newer).
2. In the project directory run:

```bash
npm start
```

3. Open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to play.

The previous 3D prototype is still available in `index3d.html` if you want to try it out.
